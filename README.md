#Cordova Dgram Plugin test application

This app is an Ionic Framework application I use for testing changes to the
[Cordova Dgram plugin](http://github.com/digitalcatnip/cordova-plugin-dgram).
You are free to do with it as you wish.  The app is licensed under GPLv2.

I recommend changing the IP Address and Port in the app.js file if you plan
to use this.  I normally check that packets are sent correctly using netcat.
